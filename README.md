# **Biography**

I am a third year MS/Ph.D. student of [Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). I do my research under the supervision of [Prof. Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/) and [Ramesh K. Sitaraman](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/ramesh/lids-lab/) (co-adivsors). I started my master program on Fall 2019, and it's currently ongoing. Before joining UMass, I received my B.Sc. degree at the department of Computer Engineering at the Sharif University of Technology. Prof. [Ali Sharifi-Zarchi](http://ce.sharif.edu/faculty/ali-sharifi-zarchi/) was my advisor.
