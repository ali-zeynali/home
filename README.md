# **Biography**
I am a Ph.D. student of [Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). I do my research under the supervision of Prof. [Mohammad Hajiesmaili](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/hajiesmaili/) and [Ramesh K. Sitaraman](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/ramesh/lids-lab/) (co-adivsors). I received my master's degree from UMass with grade 4.0/4.0. Before joining UMass, I received my B.Sc. degree at the department of Computer Engineering at the Sharif University of Technology. Prof. Ali Sharifi-Zarchi was my advisor.
